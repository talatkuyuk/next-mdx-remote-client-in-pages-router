The **`next-mdx-remote-client`** is a powerful library that allows you to =r=render MDX content== on the client side 
or on the server side in a `Next.js` application.

:::tip Dynamic MDX Contents
This tool is also useful when you need to handle =g=dynamic MDX content== 
fetched from an external API or any other source that isn't available at build time.
:::

In this article, handling dynamic MDX content that isn't available at build time is going to be explained.

## Installation
To install `next-mdx-remote-client`, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
# with npm
npm install next-mdx-remote-client
# with yarn
yarn add next-mdx-remote-client
```

## Usage
### Basic Setup
First, import the library and use it in your component:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { MDXClient, type SerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote-client';

const { components } from "../mdxComponents"

const MyMDXComponent = () => {
  const [mdxContent, setMdxContent] = useState<SerializeResult | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch the MDX content from your API
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const res = await fetch('/api/mdx-content');
      const data = await res.json();
      setMdxContent(data);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (!mdxContent) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if ("error" in mdxContent) {
	return <div>{mdxContent.error.message}</div>;
  }

  return <MDXClient {...mdxContent} components={components} />;
};

export default MyMDXComponent;
```

### Fetching and Serializing MDX Content in API
To =r=fetch and serialize== MDX content, you can use a server-side function or an API route in `Next.js`:

```javascript
// pages/api/mdx-content.js
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote-client/serialize';

export default async (req, res) => {
  const source = getSourceSomeHow();
  const mdxSource = await serialize({source, options: {
    disableImports: true,
    parseFrontmatter: true,
    scope: {
      readingTime: calculateSomeHow(source),
    },
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [
        // ...
      ],
      rehypePlugins: [
        // ...
      ],	
    },
  }});

  res.status(200).json(mdxSource);
};
```
